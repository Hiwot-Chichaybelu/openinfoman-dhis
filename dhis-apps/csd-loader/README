This assume nginx (or other transparent proxy) has been installed to redirect https://localhost/ILR requests to a CSD InfoManager

The following can be added to /etc/nginx/sites-available/dhis to accomplish this

  #pass on CSD requests to ILR
  location /ILR {
    rewrite    ^/ILR/(.*) /$1 break;
    proxy_pass  http://localhost:8984;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_set_header   Host $host;
  }
